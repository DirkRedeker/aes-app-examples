# aes-app-examples

Welcome to the ServiceNow Developer Program's repository of apps created with App Engine Studio and synced to github. You will find examples of apps created by developer advocates as well as (hopefully) community contributed apps. These apps should be created from and built _mostly_ in App Engine Studio and then pushed to a git repo.

### We invite you to contribute

1. Build an App in App Engine Studio.
2. Connect your app to a git repo.
3. Fork this repo (you get a point just by forking!).
4. Update the repo by adding a link to the AES App List to your repo.
5. Submit a pull request!

### AES App List

* [departmental-request](https://github.com/ServiceNowDevProgram/departmental-request) - App that handles requests to a specific department. Tables, catalog, workspace, flows, approvals, and security.
